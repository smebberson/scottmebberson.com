	I often want to create quick and dirty prototypes, usually for demonstration purposes. Sometimes I want dynamic capabilitiy, such as that offered by Node.js and sometimes I don't. But I always want to easily serve static files.

	I've created [some boilerplate code in the form of a gist][gist] to make this really quick and simple (you can view the few lines of code required to create the static server below). The [node-static module][nodestatic] is responsible for the very few lines of code. Follow the [readme in the gist][gistreadme] to get started.
