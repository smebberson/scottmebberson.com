title: My new site
template: post.jade


# Welcome to my new site

I decided to rewrite my personal website. As usual, I've gone for an entirely new set of technologies. I found it helps me to get perspective on the core set of technologies we use The Memphis Agency.

So, the stack this time is:

	* node.js
	* wintersmith, which is a static site generator
	* coffeescript, for any scripting
	* markdown and jade, for templating
	* git, for versioning and distribution

I'm quite enjoying the new stack. Especially the ability to just type out my words in markdown, rebuild using Wintersmith and then deploy using git.

It makes it so simple!
